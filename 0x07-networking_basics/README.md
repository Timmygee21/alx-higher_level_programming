In this project we will mainly focus on: <br>

The Transport layer and especially TCP/UDP <br>
On the Network layer with IP and ICMP <br>
The image bellow describes more concretely how you can relate to every level <br>

Questions: <br>

What is the OSI model? <br>

Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect <br>
The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology <br>
